# Etsy-Web-Scraper

This is the first project for my portfolio.
Its an etsy webscraper. It can use etsy's search function, navigate to the last page and add each shop's catalogue found in the search.
There's a lot of information to parse through. I'm working on adding it to an excel sheet to track sales prices and store popularity once a month. I have a friend that sells on etsy, so it has some use for him.
The broader use it has is to find vendors that are scamming people. Vendors will copy paste peoples products into a different store, sell it, but never ship it.
The search can be set to the products name and find all items in a catalogue of a scam vendor.

I would greatly apreciate any input on this. This is my first solo project. I'm quite excited how it turned out, but efficency isn't my strength yet. Thanks for taking time to look at this.
There is inline explanations for what the code is doing. If its confusing in any way, please let me know.
